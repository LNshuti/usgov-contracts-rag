## Evaluation Metrics

### Accuracy of Generated SQL Code:

**Exact Match:** Percentage of cases where the generated SQL query perfectly matches the intended SQL query.

**Execution Accuracy:** Percentage of cases where the generated SQL query, when executed against the database, produces the correct result set.

### Subjective User Feedback: 

After each generated SQL query, have the user rate its helpfulness on a scale (e.g., 1-5).

**Query Complexity:** Categorize queries as "simple," "medium," or "complex" and track how well each model performs across these categories.
Faithfulness:

### Query Equivalence:
Generate different SQL queries representing the same result. Test each model's ability to recognize when different queries yield identical results. This assesses how well the model understands the natural language input.

## Integrating Evaluation Metrics into your Streamlit Application

### Metric Capture:

**User Feedback:** 
Integrate simple rating widgets after each model response in your Streamlit app.

**Accuracy Metrics:** Modify your code to compare the generated SQL query:
With the ground truth (exact match).
Execute the query and compare the result with the expected result (execution accuracy).

**Data Logging:**

**Streamlit Session State:** Utilize Streamlit session state to store query results, user ratings, and other evaluation data points temporarily.

External Logging: Choose a suitable method:
Simple CSV File: Write the metrics to a CSV file on the fly for immediate analysis.
Database: Log into a small database (e.g., SQLite) for a more structured solution.
Cloud Logging Services: Integrate with cloud services (e.g., AWS CloudWatch) for scalable logging, but this will increase complexity.
Analysis & Visualization (within Streamlit):

Simple Aggregations: Calculate and display average accuracy scores, rating distributions, etc., in your Streamlit interface.
Comparison Charts: Use Streamlit's charting capabilities to visualize model performance across different metrics over time.
Testing with GROQ, Mixtral, and LlamaChat

### Index Creation:
Follow GROQ, Mixtral, and LlamaChat documentation to create indices.
Integration:
Update your Streamlit app to instantiate service contexts for each model. Keep the response generation and evaluation logic consistent to isolate model comparisons.
Comparative Logging:
Ensure that your logging approach records the model used for each query generation.
